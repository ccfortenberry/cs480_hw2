# CS480 HW2
The second hw for the game design class and boy howdy was it a trainwreck! It's only twice that I've had to try and design something through pure code and only now am I realizing just how spoiled I am with Godot and UE having (relatively) nice user interfaces, amongst other things. About the only thing I didn't do to fulfill all the requirements was make my own art and that is a journey in and of itself and required much more time than I allowed myself. I'm glad I'll never be coming back to clean these up and that they're basically sandboxes to thrash around in, which is great for learning, but may what ever deity that happens to have the free time help me if this comes up in a job interview or something...

## Art assets that don't belong to me
